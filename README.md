# GalaxyMCRServerModpack
This is the official modlist for the GalaxyMC: Reborn server. You can download it [here](https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/GalaxyMCRServerModpack/releases).
### Pre-releases
If you download a pre-release, please note that you will be unable to join the minecraft server. This is because I don't install pre-releases on the server, to prevent crashing/data corruption due to mods not playing nice with eachother. Pre-releases are exclusively for early-bird testing, hence why I don't announce them anywhere. Whenever I push a new release, I'll post it [here](https://discord.gg/wPE5VfBVUM), or you can browse the [Releases page](https://github.com/SeaswimmerTheFsh/GalaxyMCRServerModpack/releases). Anything labeled as *Pre-release* or ``-indev`` is a pre-release version and will not be the same as what is being run on the server.
